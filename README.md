 in detail 

The avg test accuracy is **52.5%.**  
From 2000 to 2019, the **average return** of long short portfolio is **25.25%**, **Sharpe ratio** is **1.74** and **max drawdown** is **5.33%** on 201503.  
The model is verified as robust, inline with investor perception and able to capture predictive patterns.  
The model is still need the test of transferability and its distinction compared with other machine learning method, like LSTM.
